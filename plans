40: Jesus fasted in the wildreness for 40 days so it could repesent leaving something behind "purging, cleansing or removal"
70: There were 70 elders of Israel who represented the full council and it took 70 years to remove impurities. Representing "final judgement, or completition"
Just a small joke, nothing serious :D

0. Create options for user to select deletion or check. Make as accessable as possible. Such as:
    Target      |   Check status    |   Removal
                |                   |
    Intune      |        [X]        |     [X]
    Autopilot   |        [X]        |     [X]
    Entra       |        [X]        |     [ ]

Always and I mean ALWAYS get user confirmation on deletion. List devices such as:

    Color codes: Red for not found, green for found.
    Maybe add device owner as an info as well?
    If user has only checked CHECK STATUS box DO NOT remove.

    PWABC123    Intune   Autopilot   Entra
    PW123ABC    Intune   Autopilot   Entra
    PW1A2B3C    Intune   Autopilot   Entra

    [Continue] [Cancel]

    Devices listed above will be deleted as per selection.
    Click "Continue" below to continue deletion

As for deletion, keep user informed on what's going on. Maybe with color codes?


    PWABC123    Intune   Autopilot   Entra
    PW123ABC    Intune   Autopilot   Entra
    PW1A2B3C    Intune   Autopilot   Entra

    Waiting for all devices to be deleted before continuing... Please wait.

When devices are deleted, continue to autopilot. The user has seen earlier if the device is found and if it's deleted or not.
The user has also selected if it's for deletion or not. If a device is already deleted or not found, we can ignore it (maybe?)
If somehow there is also a device, that's not meant to be there, we can just cross it out for checkout and not deletion.

Stuff to remember:
1. Fetch devices from list from webpage
2. Fetch devices with deviceList
3. List devices from fetch
 2.1 If length of returned devices is greater than given list - inform user
4. Create a prompt for user to remove devices
